Hello world!

My name is Paul Jones and I am a Site Reliability/DevOps Engineer with twenty yearsâ€™ progressive experience providing systems administration for
enterprise-level virtualization, networking, and storage fabrics.

Through my career I have worked with (and trained and in turn been trained by) recent college graduates, former dishwashers turned cybersecurity experts, and career long   information systems professionals. These individuals have hailed from and worked on every continent in the world and they all hold one thing in common: curisoty.
