# My attempt to build a real-world development primer for students and working adults!
 
Hello, world!
 
My name is Paul Jones and I am a Site Reliability/DevOps Engineer with twenty years of progressive experience providing systems administration for enterprise-level virtualization, networking, and storage fabrics.
 
Throughout my career, I have worked with (and trained and in turn been trained by) recent college graduates, former dishwashers turned cybersecurity experts and career-long information systems professionals. These individuals have hailed from and worked on every continent in the world and they all hold one thing in common: curiosity and tenacity!
 
It is my intention to share the knowledge and practices that I have learned over that time in a progressive and easy-to-follow format in order to help guide more individuals into the world of programming languages and information systems. I believe that the more individual contributors that are able to share their creativity and add their unique values and experiences to the accumulated store of useful information, the more we will all progress together!
