Introduction:

My aim is to create and maintain an open-source, community-driven repository that will be pubically avaiable and updated with the latest information necessary to help develop the skills necessary to bring adults and young learners into the worlds or web and software development!
To begin, I think that it is best to lay a foundation that we can use to buld the skills that we will need.
